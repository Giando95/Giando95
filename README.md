***Multi-Risk Ranking for Ground Instabilities***

**Description:**
The "mhr" repository is a comprehensive implementation of the research paper titled "A Novel Model for Multi-Risk Ranking of Buildings at City Level: The Test Site of Rome, Italy." The goal of this project is to automate the process of multi-risk ranking for ground instabilities (*i.e., Landslides, Sinkholes, and Subsidence*) of urban assets, thereby enhancing urban resilience to geohazards.

The paper focuses on the fusion of geohazards and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) ground motion data to assess and rank multiple risks associated with ground instabilities in urban environments.

**Data Storage:**
Due to the size of the input data involved in the research, the repository does not directly store the data files. Instead, the data has been archived and stored in the Zenodo platform, accessible through the DOI link: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8203352](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8203352). This ensures that the data is openly accessible, citable, and remains linked to this research project.

**Contributions:**
The "mhr" repository welcomes contributions from the research community and collaborators interested in advancing the field of urban resilience, geohazards, and InSAR data fusion. Researchers, developers, and practitioners are encouraged to participate, submit issues, propose improvements, and collaborate on this valuable endeavor.

**Features:**
- Automated multi-risk ranking algorithms for ground instabilities in urban assets.
- Integration of geohazards and InSAR ground motion data for comprehensive risk assessment.
- Data preprocessing and fusion techniques to handle large-scale input data.

**Usage:**
Researchers and practitioners in the field of geohazards, urban planning, disaster management, and geospatial analysis can utilize this repository as a resource for automating the assessment of ground instabilities in urban areas. By integrating multiple risk factors and leveraging the power of InSAR data, this project aims to enhance urban resilience and decision-making processes.

**License:**
The "mhr" repository is made available under an open-source license, allowing the community to freely use, modify, and distribute the codebase while complying with the licensing terms.
